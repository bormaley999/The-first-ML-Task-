# The first ML Task
This is the outcome of the 2-days intro ML course held by Skillbox team.
Important Note: I know Python 3 for only 3 days now =).

The .csv file is the source data (dataset) I used to build the model. The currency is AUD time period presented in the report is between 01.01.18 and 24.06.2019.
The ML library is scikit-learn. 
I used Linear Regression function "
```py
class sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression(fit_intercept=True, normalize=False, copy_X=True, n_jobs=None)".
```
Specifically, this example: `reg = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)`.
